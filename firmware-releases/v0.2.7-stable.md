# V0.2.7 - Stable

This release introduces the following enhancements:

* I2C Peripheral mode of operation now supports BANK commands. Now the entire register bank can be read/written to with a single command to Nova. See the python library example [here](https://github.com/binhollc/binho-python-package/blob/main/binho/examples/11_i2c_peripheral_demo.py#L160).
* IO pins now have a Toggle\(\) command which can instruct Nova to perform a toggle of a precise time duration \(from 5microseconds to 265milliseconds\). See the python library example [here](https://github.com/binhollc/binho-python-package/blob/main/binho/examples/30_digitalio_toggle_demo.py).
* SPI CS pin can now be automatically controlled by Nova in firmware, allowing for the CS pin edges to be tightly coupled to the SPI data transfers. No longer having a ~4.5ms delay to send a separate command to control the CS pin. Use Mission Control V1.1.4 or higher to take advantage of this new feature in our desktop application.

This release fixes the following bugs:

* _None_
