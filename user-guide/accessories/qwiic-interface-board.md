# Qwiic Interface Board

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

Our friends over at Sparkfun introduced us to [Qwiic Connect System](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) and we're loving it. This board makes it easy for you to interface your Binho host adapter with up to 4 strings of Qwiic devices, as well as breaking out all of the pins to a series of headers that make it very convenient to jump to other circuits, as well as hook up your Logic Analyzer to monitor everything while you develop and debug. This board is 25mm x 35mm and comes with the connectors pre-soldered. The headers are included but not installed.

This accessory is available for purchase in our online store [here](https://binho.io/collections/accessories/products/qwiic-breakout).
