# Accessories

There are a number of accessories available that can make using a _Binho Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter_ even more convenient.

First in line is the breadboard breakout, making it easy to interface with 0.1" headers. This is such a common need that one of these is included with the host adapter, but it's good to know where to get more:

Qwiic is a fairly new open standard when it comes to hooking up I2C devices, brought to the world by [Sparkfun Electronics](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) and gaining adoption across the open-source hardware industry. We've made a board which makes it easy to interface the _Binho Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter_ with qwiic devices. This board is also a great way to breakout the header to a number of pins which can easily be jumped to other circuits or observed with your logic analyzer.

If you're working with a fixture or board that was designed for use with another common host adapter, but you'd like to find an easy way to get it hooked up to your Binho Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter, then perhaps the Total Retrofitter is exactly what you're looking for:
