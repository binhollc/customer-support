### Device Description

The _Binho Nova Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter_ allows one to interface their computer directly to hardware circuits. This device is powered by the USB connection to the host PC and is also able to provide downstream power to test circuits.

The _Binho Nova Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter_ features 5 signal pins, 1 x 3v3 pin, 1 x VUSB pin, and 3 x GND pins on its 10pin wire harness. The wire harness terminates with a female 1.27mm 2x5 IDC connector. In IO Mode, the 5 signal pins can be used for varying functions such as Digital Input, Digital Output, PWM Output, Digital Interrupt (on rising edge, falling edge, or change), Analog Input, or Analog Output.

Additionally, the host adapter is able to utilize these pins to communicate on several digital buses: I2C, SPI, UART, (Dallas)1-Wire, and (Atmel) Single-Wire Interface. While in these modes of operation, remaining available pins can be assigned to other related or unrelated purposes such as gpio, interrupts, chip selects, PWM signals, or analog input or outputs.

The _Binho Nova Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter_ is ideal for manual testing during firmware development and debugging as well as a perfect way to automate hardware testing and validation. A common use-case of this product in production environments is for EEPROM/Flash Memory programming along with functional testing activities.

### Included Components

The _Binho Nova Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter_ comes along with a helpful [breadboard breakout adapter](https://binho.io/collections/accessories/products/breadboard-breakout) and with a 1 foot USB type C (male) to type A (male) cable in a soft-shell zippered case.
