# What protocols are supported?

The _Binho Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter_ currently supports SPI, I2C, UART, Dallas 1-Wire, and Atmel Single-Wire Interface. Beyond these protocols, the device also can operate in IO mode where the pins can be configured to use other peripherals, such as ADC inputs, DAC output, or just standard GPIO.
