# Can multiple devices be used at the same time?

**Yes!** One of the key features is that it's easy to use multiple devices on the same computer at the same time. Each device will be enumerated as a different COM port on the machine. This eliminates device management headaches and limitations that occur when using other types of USB device classes. 

Our Python library was designed for usage with multiple host adapters connected to a PC and provides mechanisms for straightforward device management, both within scripts and on the command line interface.

In the case of using our Mission Control GUI software with multiple devices, simply launch multiple instances of Mission Control for each device.
