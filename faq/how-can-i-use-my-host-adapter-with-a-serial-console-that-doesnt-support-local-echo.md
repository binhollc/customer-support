# How can I use my host adapter with a serial console that doesn't support Local Echo?

The Binho Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter can be configured to echo all the received characters in cases where local echo is not an option. This ensure seamless usage of your host adapter in as many environments as possible. The echo mode is off by default on device power-up but can be toggled by sending the ["+ECHO" command](https://support.binho.io/user-guide/using-the-device/device-settings#echo).
