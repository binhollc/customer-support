# Experimental Features

Interested in trying out some of our newest features? This is the place for you! So, what does it mean to be an 'experimental feature'?  Well, right now, these are features for which we are implementing proof-of-concept functional support in our products to gather feedback. These features have undergone a fair amount of internal testing already, but may lack strong supporting documentation.

The following features are currently available for public usage:

{% content-ref url="daplink-mode.md" %}
[daplink-mode.md](daplink-mode.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you're using any of our experimental features, we want to hear from you! Please write in to **support@binho.io** and let us know your thoughts and feedback so we can continue to improve them. Experimental features may eventually graduate and be assimilated into our standard feature set, or abandoned entirely.
