# Binho Python Package

With to incredible feedback and support from our customers, we've released an entirely rebuilt python library for Binho Nova. While we'll continue to support our previous library, active development will only take place on this one.

Aside from taking a more _**pythonic**_ approach to implementing the library, we've also introduced a lot of structure and abstraction to make it even easier to use your Nova, including a command line interface and interactive shell. We've also baked numerous example scripts right into the library for easy reference.
