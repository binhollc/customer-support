# Replaying Logic Captures

{% hint style="success" %}
We highly encourage everyone to use our[ new Python package](https://support.binho.io/python-libraries/binho-python-package) which is packed with features. This library is still supported, but is not recommended for new design.
{% endhint %}

The _Binho Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter_ paired with a [Saleae Logic](https://www.saleae.com/) is the perfect combination for making hardware testing as simple as possible. Furthermore, Logic captures of UART, SPI, and I2C transactions can be exported and then replayed by _Binho_. This makes it very easy to recreate a test case or repeat a given stimuli that you've captured with Logic. Please see the samples below for each of the protocols.
