# Customer Support Portal

Welcome to our customer support site! You can browse the articles from the content links on the left, or locate specific information using the search bar in the upper-right corner of the page.

The best way to get familiar with the _Binho Nova Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter_, whether you own one or not, is to have a read through our Getting Started guide:

{% hint style="success" %}
Our documentation is now updated to demonstrate our _NEW_ Python library. Details [here](https://support.binho.io/python-libraries/binho-python-package).
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="getting-started/" %}
[getting-started](getting-started/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

There's also the complete product User Guide here which provides in-dept explanations on all of the devices functionality:

{% content-ref url="user-guide/" %}
[user-guide](user-guide/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You may have noticed that our documentation is using some unfamiliar terms when discussing the roles and signals for a given protocol. We've dropped the use of legacy terms which may initially cause confusion, so we've put together a helpful resource here:

{% content-ref url="learn-and-grow/dropping-legacy-terminology.md" %}
[dropping-legacy-terminology.md](learn-and-grow/dropping-legacy-terminology.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Finally, this portal contains a full set of documentation for the ASCII command set as well as the documentation of the Python library. This section includes a number of examples that demonstrate how to use the _Binho Nova Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter_ in many common use-cases such as reading/writing EEPROM, FLASH, and FRAM devices, interfacing I2C/SPI/1-WIRE sensors directly to your computer, and communicating with common CryptoAuth chips from Microchip (formerly Atmel).
