# Tax Exemption

If your company is except from paying taxes and our product will ship within the United States, please provide us with your tax exemption certificate in advance of placing your order. Contact us at **support@binho.io** and include an attachment of your tax exemption certificate. We'll follow up with confirmation after approval, and then your future orders will be tax-free.

### Refund of Tax Charges

If your order has already been shipped, then the sales has already been collected. We'll do our best to refund the tax charges after you provide us with your certificate of exemption. Note that we can only process tax refunds for orders placed directly on our website.
