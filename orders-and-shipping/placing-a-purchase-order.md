# Placing a Purchase Order

Purchase Orders are the recommended method for companies who cannot place orders with credit card directly on our website. In order to ensure a smooth order process, please make sure the PO includes the following information:

* Billing Address
* Shipping Address
* Purchase Order Number
* Phone Number
* Product Name(s) and Quantities
* Prices in US Dollars
* Shipping Method:
  * Please include your FedEx/UPS Account Number if shipping will be on your account
  * Please indicate "Binho to Prepay Shipping - Add to Invoice" if not using your shipping account
* Email Address and contact information for Accounts Payable department

### Payment Terms

Net 30 payment terms are offered to customers with a history of timely payments. For your first order, we will generate a Proforma Invoice which must be pre-paid. We will then ship the order on the first business day after the payment has been received.
