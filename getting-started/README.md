# Getting Started

Welcome to our Getting Started Guide. The _Binho Nova_ was designed for ultimate flexibility, as such, there are multiple ways to control and interact with it. First, follow the Hardware Setup Guide to quickly get your device connected to the host computer and your electronics:

Once everything is connected, follow the guides below to learn how to interact with the Binho Nova using our GUI Software, Python Libraries and a Serial Console.

### Level \#1 - GUI Guide

The easiest way to get familiar with your _Binho Nova_ is by taking it for a test drive with our cross-platform desktop GUI software. Even if you intend to use it in automated environments and applications, the GUI is a great starting point before diving in to writing scripts.

### Level \#3 - ASCII Guide

And when you're ready to go to the deepest level of device interaction to learn how to control it from any language/platform capable of opening a serial port and sending ASCII text, have a look at the guide below. This guide is presented using CoolTerm due to it's elegant GUI and relatively identical performance across all the platforms supported by the _Binho Nova_.
